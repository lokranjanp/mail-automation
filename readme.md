**MAIL AUTOMATION WITH SMTP**

This is a mail - automation project I developed as an interest towards SMTP and other Computer Networks topics.
I tried integrating this project with a database just to make it more fun. 

I have used the following technologies and packages to make this project work :
1) Python- Dotenv (to work with my .env variables that contain important passkeys)
2) MySQL python connector for integrating DB with the python script
3) SMTP python package
4) MIME package

I have used the OOP approach for this project to show my knowledge of OOP and my adaptability to work in any scripting 
language with ease.
[I could probably implement the same project in Java given enough documentation on the required packages :) ]
